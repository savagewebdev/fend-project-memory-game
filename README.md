## Playing the game

Introduction: Robin's Matching Game is a timed & scored memory card game. The goal is to complete the game in the least amount of time with the least amount of total moves, thus challenging you--the player--to utilize his or her memory to complete it. The game begins with a score of 3 stars and the timer set at 0. Each attepted move counts toward the removal of the stars counted at the end of the game, and the game itself ends when all of the cards have been successfully matched.

Beginning: The game loads automatically in the browser. The clock will begin counting upon loading the game and will continue until the conclusion of the game.

Moves: Each move is comprised of a single attempted pairing of cards. In addition to impacting the ending score, each move is counted and incremented at the top of the game's GUI. To begin a move, simply click on a memory card of your choice to flip it over and click on a another card to see if it matches the first card. If the pair of cards flipped during the match, they will remain open. If the cards do not match, they will flip back over facing down. The amount of moves will be counted as the game progresses and will be displayed at the game's end. 

Goal: Each move counts against the game's final score. The game begins with a score of 3 and is displayed by the stars located on the top of the game's GUI. Once again, the goal of the game is to complete the game in the least amount of time with the least amount of total moves, thus challenging the player to utilize his or her memory to complete it.

Completion: Once all of the cards have been matched successfully, the total score is displayed along with the time it took to complete it. An option is also given to play again.

Reset/Playing Again: To start a game over, or to play again, simply press the "Reset" button located at the top right corner of the game's GUI.
